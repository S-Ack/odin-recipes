        <li>1 (1 ounce) bottle red food coloring</li>
        <li>1 fluid ounce water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 
        2 9-inch cake pans. In a bowl, sift cake flour with baking soda.</li>
    <li>Mash the vegetable shortening with 1 1/2 cup of sugar in a large 
    bowl until thoroughly combined, and stir in the eggs, one at a time. 
    Pour the red food coloring into a small bowl, and fill the empty food 
    coloring container with water; add the water to the food coloring. 
    Stir in cocoa powder to make a paste, and mix the paste into the 
    shortening mixture.</li>
    <li>Stir the buttermilk, salt, vanilla extract, and apple cider vinegar 
        in a bowl, and mix into the colored shortening mixture, alternating 
        with the flour mixture, until well combined. Scrape the batter into 
        the prepared cake pans.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the 
        center of a cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow the cakes 
        to cool completely.</li>
    <li>To make frosting, whisk together the milk and all-purpose flour in 
        a saucepan until the mixture is free of lumps, and bring to a 
        simmer over medium-low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until the 
        mixture is thick, about 1 minute. Pour the thickened sauce into a 
        mixing bowl, and chill until completely cooled, at least 30 minutes. 
        When cold, place the butter into the mixture, and beat with an 
        electric mixer to combine; add the vanilla extract and 2 cups of sugar 
        to the bowl, and beat with the mixer set on Medium speed until the 
        frosting is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
        As a substitute for buttermilk, you can also make sour milk by 
        adding about 2 tablespoons of vinegar into liquid measuring cup, 
        then add milk to make 1 cup.
