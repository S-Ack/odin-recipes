   <h2>Decription</h2>
   <p>This recipe was given to me by my Italian best friend. It is the type 
    of crustless cheesecake that is sold in Italian bakeries in New York. I 
    usually make it with whole-milk ricotta which is creamier than low fat. 
    This is not a diet item! You can add fresh fruit topping if you desire.</p>

   <p><strong>Prep: 20 mins</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Cook: 1 hr</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Additional: 3 hrs</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Total: 4 hrs 20 mins</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Servings: 12</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Yield: 1 10-inch cheesecake</strong></p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>1 pound cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 pound ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice (Optional)</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the 
        middle of the oven.</li>
   <li>Beat the cream cheese, ricotta cheese, and sugar in a large mixing bowl 
    with an electric mixer until well combined. Beat in the eggs, one at a 
    time. Add the butter, flour, cornstarch, and vanilla extract; mix until 
    well combined. Fold in the sour cream and lemon juice. Pour the mixture 
    into an ungreased 10-inch springform pan.</li>
   <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn off the oven and leave the 
    cheesecake in the oven for 2 more hours. Remove from oven and let cool 
    completely. Run a thin spatula around the edge of the cheesecake before 
    springing open the pan to remove. Serve at room temperature or cold; 
    refrigerate leftovers.</li>
